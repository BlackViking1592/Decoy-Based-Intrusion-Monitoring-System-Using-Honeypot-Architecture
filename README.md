# Decoy-Based-Intrusion-Monitoring-System-Using-Honeypot-Architecture
A lightweight and security system that uses decoy endpoints (honeypots) to detect, analyze, and log unauthorized access attempts in real time. This project simulates a protected infrastructure by exposing realistic fake endpoints and monitoring attacker behavior without risking real assets.
